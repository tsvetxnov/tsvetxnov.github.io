## Choosing Weights

- **Goal**: The aim of your HIIT sessions is to balance **muscle endurance and conditioning**. Since the rep range is higher (10-15 reps), focus on picking a weight that allows you to perform all reps with **good form**, but that challenges you towards the final reps.

- **Choosing Weights**:
    - If you can‚Äôt reach the **high rep range** with a heavier weight, **lower the weight** so you can complete the reps.
    - Use an **RPE scale** (Rate of Perceived Exertion) of 7-9:
        - **RPE 8**: You should have 2-3 reps left in the tank by the last rep.
        - **RPE 9**: You should be close to failure, but not fully exhausted.
    - Gradually increase the weight as you progress, but always aim to maintain **proper form** over pushing heavier weights.

# Jogging
## Starting Out
- **Distance**: Could only jog around **1.2 km** before feeling burning in head and nose.
- **Reasons for Burning Sensation**:
	- **Cold or Dry Air**: Breathing in cold/dry air can cause irritation.
	- **Overexertion**: Pushing too hard without pacing properly.
	- **Poor Breathing Technique**: Shallow breathing causing discomfort.
	- **Dehydration**: Can dry out the throat and nose.
	- **Allergies**: Potential reaction to pollutants or allergens.

## How to Build Jogging Endurance
If you‚Äôre aiming to increase your jogging distance:

- Start with a comfortable distance (e.g., **2-3 km**), then **gradually increase** by **0.5 km per week**.
- If you can jog for **15-20 minutes** without stopping, gradually extend your sessions to **25-30 minutes** over time.
## Solutions to Improve Jogging
- **Breathing Techniques**:
	- Focus on **diaphragmatic breathing** (deep belly breathing).
	- Use a **3:2 rhythmic breathing pattern**: Inhale for 3 steps, exhale for 2 steps.
- **Pacing**: Start slower to build endurance and avoid overexertion.
- **Hydration**: Stay hydrated before and after jogging sessions.
- **Build Gradually**: Start with **1-2 minute intervals of jogging** and walking, gradually reducing walking time.
- **Cold Weather**: Use a scarf or mask to warm and humidify the air in cold conditions.

# Diet and Caloric Intake

## Food
### Daily Caloric Target
- **TDEE**: ~**2940 kcal/day** (to maintain weight)
- **Fat loss target**: ~**2300-2400 kcal/day** for sustainable fat loss.

### Sweets and Desserts
- Enjoy in **moderation**.
- **Best practice**: Limit to **small portions** after workouts. Look for **low-sugar alternatives** like dark chocolate or fruit-based treats.

### –¢–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä —Å —á–µ—Å—ä–Ω (Post-Workout Drink)
- **Calories**: 30 kcal per 100ml. 
- **500 ml bottle**: 150 kcal, making it a good **low-calorie** post-workout drink.
- **Benefits**: Good for **hydration** and **digestive health** due to yogurt probiotics.

### Home-Cooked Meal Calorie Estimates
- **Meat-based dishes**: ~500-700 kcal per plate.
- **Vegetable-based dishes**: ~350-500 kcal per plate.
- **Dishes with sauces/fried foods**: ~700-900 kcal per plate

## Note on Protein 
- **Protein powder** (often referred to as "protein dust") is generally safe and useful, even at 18. It's simply a **supplement** to help you reach your daily protein targets, especially if you struggle to get enough protein through food alone.
### Key Points
- **Not harmful**: There‚Äôs no evidence to suggest protein powder is harmful for young adults, as long as it‚Äôs consumed in **appropriate amounts**.
 - **Daily protein goals**: Aim to get most of your protein from whole foods, but supplementing with a protein shake post-workout or as a snack is perfectly fine. Stick to **1-2 scoops per day** (around **20-30 grams of protein per scoop**).
- **Use in moderation**: Over-relying on protein powder instead of whole foods can cause you to miss out on other essential nutrients found in whole protein sources (like vitamins and minerals).
### How to Use Protein Powder Safely
- **Post-workout**: It‚Äôs most beneficial to consume protein powder **after your workout** to aid muscle repair and recovery.
- **Balanced diet**: Ensure your overall diet is balanced with carbs, fats, and vitamins to support overall health, not just muscle growth.

# Important Notes
## 1. Prioritize a Caloric Deficit for Abs

- **Abs are revealed through fat loss**, and the key to this is maintaining a **caloric deficit**. Your workout routine will help, but diet plays an even bigger role.
    - Track your calorie intake if you aren‚Äôt already. Aim to **lose 0.5-1 kg per week**, which ensures sustainable fat loss while maintaining muscle.
    - Focus on **high-protein meals** to preserve muscle while losing fat. Aim for **1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight**.

## 2. HIIT and Cardio Balance

- **HIIT is highly effective** for fat loss because it burns a lot of calories in a short time and boosts your metabolism. However, **too much HIIT** can lead to burnout or overtraining if not managed properly.
    - Make sure you‚Äôre getting enough **rest and recovery** (which leads to point 3).
    - On cardio days, **gradually increase** the time or intensity as your endurance improves, but keep track of your recovery.

## 3. Prioritize Recovery

- Recovery is when your muscles grow and your body adapts to the training. If you‚Äôre constantly pushing yourself with full-body HIIT and cardio, you need to focus on these recovery factors:
    - **Sleep**: Aim for **7-9 hours** of quality sleep each night.
    - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially around workouts. Dehydration can negatively affect both performance and fat loss.
    - **Active recovery**: Use your rest day (Sunday) for light activities like walking, yoga, or stretching to help with blood flow and recovery.

## 4. Nutrition is Key to Seeing Results

- **Protein powder** can support muscle recovery, but ensure it fits into your overall nutrition plan. A balanced diet is key:
    - **Whole Foods**: Prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods like lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.
    - **Meal Timing**: If you're only eating one big meal a day, consider spreading your intake across **2-3 meals** for better energy levels and muscle repair throughout the day.
    - **Supplements**: If you‚Äôre not getting enough from food, consider taking **Vitamin D3** (especially if you‚Äôre indoors a lot) and **Omega-3** (fish oil) to support muscle recovery and joint health.

## 5. Monitor Progress, Adjust as Needed

- **Track your workouts and nutrition** to ensure you're on the right path. Here‚Äôs what to track:
    - **Weight** and **measurements**: Keep track of your weight and waist measurements weekly to monitor fat loss.
    - **Strength gains**: Track your lifts and RPE. If you're consistently increasing your weights or reps, you‚Äôre making progress.
    - **Fat loss**: You should aim to feel leaner and notice gradual fat loss over your abs.

## 6. Mental Consistency is Critical

- **Consistency beats intensity**. It‚Äôs better to stick to a plan and gradually build up intensity than to burn out after a few weeks.
- Stay patient‚Äî**visible abs** will take time as you need to reduce your body fat to around **10-15%**. Stay focused on the process, and the results will follow.

## 7. Mix in Variety

- Over time, your body adapts to the same workouts. To prevent plateaus:
    - Switch up exercises every **4-6 weeks** (especially for HIIT) to target muscles differently and keep challenging your body.
    - Incorporate **different cardio** (rowing, swimming, hiking) for variety and to avoid boredom.

## 8. Mind Your Form

- Proper form is **crucial** in preventing injuries and ensuring you‚Äôre getting the most out of each exercise, especially for lifts like **deadlifts** and **squats**. Focus on good form first, then increase weights.

## 9. Listen to Your Body

- If you‚Äôre feeling overly fatigued, sore, or mentally burned out, it‚Äôs a sign you might need an extra rest day or to reduce intensity. **Overtraining** can stall progress, so be mindful of how your body feels.
